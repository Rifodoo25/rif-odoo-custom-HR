# To hide(desactive) or restrict access:
#   Remove Access Rights
#   Go to Settings → Users & Companies → Users.
#   Select the user.
#   In the Access Rights tab, under Human Resources, leave the Attendances field blank.
#   This prevents the user from opening the module—even if it's installed. They’ll see an “Access Error”  #   if they try.
# To show(active) or Grant Access Rights:
#   Navigate to Settings → Users & Companies → Users.
#   Select the user you want to give access to.
#   In the Access Rights tab, scroll to Human Resources.
#   Set Attendances to Administrator.
#   This allows full access to the module, including kiosk mode, reports, and #         configuration.
